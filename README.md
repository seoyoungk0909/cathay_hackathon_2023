# Cathay Hackathon 2023: CathUSTic (Team 30)

## Our Vision
Not just a traditional low-cost airline, but a platform to empower consistent, immersive, and interactive travel experiences through unique, meaningful connections from pre-booking to post-flight.

## Product Description
Gather Together, an all-in-one platform, incorporates three key functions to align with GBA Gen Zâ€™s persona, throughout the travel journey.

- Pre-booking stage: Travel Type Test and travel destination recommendation through our AI-powered matching algorithm
- Pre-flight stage: Match travelers departing from a similar location, allowing them to split transportation expenses. This also ultimately reduces energy consumption, addressing SDG 12, responsible consumption and production.
- Post-flight stage: 'Buddy Express' allows users to join and initiate various activities, including dining and exploring heritages to build unique connections and memories
